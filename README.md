## Overview of Analysis
This analysis was conducted to better understand the clientele who utilize the Citibike network. 
Based on the gathered data, the starting and ending locations for Citibike uses can be narrowed down to mostly being in the downtown core. This makes sense as bikes would allow for quicker and more direct transportation from start to end without having to rely on public transport and be prone to delays or overcrowded buses/subways. 

## Results

### Starting Locations
![Story 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111096246/206353304-4fa4e9af-e528-4aae-9368-11d639bcda47.png)

The starting location with the highest amount of starting rides has a count of 16,564. A suggestion for the future would be to add station names to each point so that they may be better identified.

### Ending Locations

The ending location with the highest amount of finished rides has a count of 16,455, and is the same station as the one that has the highest number of starting rides.

### Checkout Time for Users
![Story 1 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111096246/206353775-761f398d-870e-45c1-8e64-88e6a325878d.png)

This graph demonstrates the length of the trip along with the number of bikes in circulation, and filtered by the hour of the day. In this case we see a spike in rides around midnight, and see the number of bikes in circulation slowly dwindle as everyone heads to bed for a good night's rest.

### Checkout Time by Genders
![Story 1 (3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111096246/206353982-b691d562-894f-4b8b-bdc9-b57059c11349.png)

Similar to the previous graph, this one adds the gender filter. It can be noted that most of the riders at midnight are male. Almost three times as many males riding bikes at this time as there are females.

### Trips by Weekday for each Hour
![Story 1 (4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111096246/206354224-2c101771-bb4f-4ba7-bbec-984f0a3348b6.png)

This heatmap shows which time, and on which day, bike usage is most popular. In this case it can be noted that Thursdays at 6:00pm are the most popular time to rent a bike with a count of 44,905 riders.

### Trips by Gender
![Story 1 (5)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111096246/206354457-43dbaa5a-bf3d-42c8-bc0f-e6e60cef536d.png)

In this heatmap, similar to the previous one, the filter of gender has been added. Thursdays at 6:00pm still remains popular for males with a count of 30,749 riders, compared to the females 11,336. The approximate ratio of 3:1 males to females can be noticed here as well.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
![Story 1 (6)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111096246/206354698-2478035e-913e-495c-a7fb-3b4024df5dd4.png)

Last, but not least, is a tabulated heatmpa illustrating which days are the mos tpopular by gender to rent a bike, and whether or not they are subscribed to Citibike or not. It can be noted that there is a large presence of subscribed male riders who most commonly ride on Thursday. 

## Summary

In short, most of the bike rides take place in the downtown core where public transport runs the risk of running late, or being overcrowded. Bikes are a faster and more direct method of transportation. There are saftey concerns with riding bikes, but by applying defensive driving and being aware of one's surroundings, one can make it from start to end without a problem. 

Males dominate Citibike usage at almost three times the amount of their female counterparts. This can be attributed to a lot of factors, but saftey for women is the most likely one. 

The fact that Thursday is the most popular day is somewhat confusing, yet the timing of 6:00pm makes snese, as most people will be leaving work, or getting some evening exercise in before heading home.

Two visualizations that may be recommended are:
- Starting and ending stations with station names, so that stations of interest may be identified with ease.
- Trip duration compared to the number of times a bike has been rented. This would help identify which bikes may need tuning and, or, repairing for further usage.
